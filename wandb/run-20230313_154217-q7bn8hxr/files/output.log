/Users/Thoma/Documents/Github/CME216-Machine-Learning/HW6/utils.py:31: RuntimeWarning:
More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
